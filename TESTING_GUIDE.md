# Next Steps and Testing Guide

This document provides guidance on what to check after completing the Firebase removal and simplified authentication implementation.

## Running the Application

To run the application after all the changes:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/mynamecard
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. If any errors occur, check:
   - Missing dependencies in package.json
   - Remaining Firebase references in code
   - Path issues in the simplified services

## Testing the Simplified Authentication

1. Open the application in your browser
2. Navigate to the login page
3. Use the credentials:
   - Username: `test`
   - Password: `test`
4. Verify you can log in successfully

## Testing Card Functionality

After logging in:

1. Create a new card
   - Verify all fields work correctly
   - Check that the card saves properly

2. Edit an existing card
   - Verify changes are saved

3. View and share cards
   - Test the public card view
   - Verify QR code generation works
   - Test vCard download functionality

## Potential Issues to Check

1. **Component Errors**: Some components may still have references to Firebase services. Look for console errors related to undefined services.

2. **Card Editor Issues**: The CardEditor.tsx file showed some compilation errors that should be fixed.

3. **Analytics**: Since we removed Firebase Analytics, make sure the application doesn't try to call any analytics methods.

4. **API Endpoints**: Check that all API endpoints are properly updated to work with the simplified services.

5. **Undefined References**: Fix any "Cannot find name" errors for Firebase-related imports.

## Maintaining the Clean Architecture

When adding new features:

1. Keep using the simplified authentication system
2. Extend the in-memory services as needed
3. Don't reintroduce Firebase dependencies
4. Document any changes to the authentication flow

The project now has a clean foundation for future development with a straightforward authentication system.
