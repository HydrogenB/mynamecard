# Fresh Start Documentation

This project has been completely revamped for a fresh start:

1. Removed all Firebase dependencies and services
2. Implemented a simplified authentication system
   - Username: test
   - Password: test
3. Created in-memory data storage for cards and user profiles
4. Removed all migration scripts and functionality
5. Simplified the codebase for easier maintenance

## Key Changes

- Replaced Firebase Auth with simpleAuthService
- Replaced Firestore with in-memory storage
- Removed all migration-related code
- Updated deployment scripts to remove migration steps
- Simplified user onboarding process

## Next Steps

The project is now ready for further development without the previous migration functionality. All data management is done in-memory and will not persist between sessions.
