# Implementation Summary

## Completed
1. Created a secure API-based architecture using Firebase Cloud Functions
   - Created Cloud Functions for all card operations (create, read, update, delete)
   - Updated cloudFunctionsService.ts to properly interact with these Functions
   - Ensured cardAPI.ts uses the cloudFunctionsService for all operations

2. Updated Firebase configuration
   - Added Functions initialization in firebase.ts
   - Simplified Firestore rules to focus on server-side security
   - Created a deployment script for Firebase Functions

3. Added user notifications
   - Updated AuthNotice component with information about the new architecture
   - Created BlazePlanNotice component to inform users about Firebase plan requirements
   - Created documentation in API_MIGRATION.md

## Next Steps

1. **Upgrade Firebase Plan**
   - Upgrade to the Firebase Blaze plan to ensure Cloud Functions work properly
   - The Blaze plan is pay-as-you-go, but includes a generous free tier

2. **Deploy Firebase Functions**
   - Run `node deploy-functions.js` after installing Firebase CLI with `npm install -g firebase-tools`
   - Ensure you're logged in with `firebase login`

3. **Test Card Operations**
   - Test creating, reading, updating, and deleting cards with the new architecture
   - Monitor the Firebase Functions logs for any errors

4. **Error Debugging**
   - If errors persist, check:
     - Firebase Cloud Functions logs in Firebase Console
     - Browser developer console for error messages
     - Authentication state to ensure users are properly authenticated

- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth)

## Troubleshooting
- If card operations fail, check the browser console for detailed error messages
- Verify that the user is properly authenticated
- Ensure Cloud Functions are properly deployed
- Check that the project is on the Firebase Blaze plan
