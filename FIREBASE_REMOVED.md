# Firebase Removal Documentation

## Changes Made

1. Removed Firebase dependencies from package.json
2. Created simple in-memory authentication system with fixed credentials:
   - Username: test
   - Password: test
3. Replaced Firebase services with simplified in-memory alternatives:
   - simpleAuthService.ts: Basic authentication
   - simpleUserService.ts: User profile management
   - simpleCardService.ts: Card data management
4. Updated all components to use the simplified services
5. Removed Firebase configuration files
6. Removed all migration scripts and code for a fresh start

## File Changes

- Updated AuthContext.tsx to use simpleAuthService
- Updated SignIn.tsx to only allow test/test login
- Simplified Dashboard.tsx, UserProfile.tsx, and other components
- Removed Firebase imports and references
- Created db.ts with simplified type definitions

## Simplified Architecture

The application now uses a simple in-memory data store that persists only for the current session.
No data is saved between sessions or synchronized across devices.

## Running the Application

1. The application can now run without Firebase configuration
2. Login using:
   - Username: test
   - Password: test
3. All data will be stored in memory and will be lost when the browser is refreshed

## Further Cleanup (if needed)

- Remove firebase.json and other Firebase configuration files if not needed
- Remove Firebase-related scripts from package.json
